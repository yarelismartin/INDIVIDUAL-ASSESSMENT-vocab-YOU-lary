# Project: vocab-YOU-lary

# Overview:
This application's name is Code Lengo Master. The application allows individual users to have their own accounts, where they can build a list of coding-related vocabularies. Users can create a vocab card by inputting the name, definition, and language type. Additionally, users have the ability to edit, view, and delete individual vocab cards. If a user doesn't find their desired programming language while creating a vocab card, they can create a new language, which will then appear in the language dropdown selection.

There is a second navbar that features filter options based on language types, and the filter buttons dynamically render based on the languages actively in use. The search bar enables users to search for cards by title and definition. 

# Features 
- CRUD Functionality: Users can create, read, update, and delete vocab cards, which are stored in their individual datasets.
- Filter Buttons: Users can filter their cards by language type, with buttons dynamically rendering based on active languages.
- Card Ordering: Cards can be ordered alphabetically, by newest, or oldest.
- Search Bar: Users can search for cards based on title and definition.
